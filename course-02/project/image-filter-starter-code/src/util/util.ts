 * okay, no clue why we get a async function, that returns a promise. that's unnecessary'.
 * if the process yields any errors, we can't catch it, because the promise doesn't handle reject case.
 * We can validate url input, but that would still result in unhandled errors, if the url is valid,
 * but doesn't exist anymore or other networking errors
 * fixed that.
 * removed promise completely and changed from write to writeAsync to get a promise to await.
 *
 * Also, the old code used __dirname, which is the directory of the file and not the project, which might get messy.
 * It's unnecessary anyway, because instead of writing to file, we can write the filtered image directly to the client,
 * saving disc i/o and processing time.
